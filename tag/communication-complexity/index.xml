      <title>Lifting Theorems for Equality</title>
      <link>https://sagnikm.github.io/publication/stacs2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We show a &lt;em&gt;deterministic simulation (or lifting) theorem&lt;/em&gt; for composed problems $f \circ \mathsf{Eq}_n$ where the inner function (the gadget) is Equality on $n$ bits. When $f$ is a total function on $p$ bits, it is easy to show via a rank argument that the communication complexity of $f\circ \mathsf{Eq}_n$ is $\Omega(deg(f) \cdot n)$. However, there is a surprising counter-example of a partial function $f$ on $p$ bits, such that any completion $f&#39;$ of $f$ has $\deg(f&#39;) = \Omega(p)$, and yet $f \circ \mathsf{Eq}_n$ has communication complexity $O(n)$. Nonetheless, we are able to show that the communication complexity of $f \circ \mathsf{Eq}_n$ is at least $D(f) \cdot n$ for a complexity measure $D(f)$ which is closely related to the AND-query complexity of $f$ and is lower-bounded by the logarithm of the leaf complexity of $f$. As a corollary, we also obtain lifting theorems for the set-disjointness gadget, and a lifting theorem in the context of parity decision-trees, for the NOR gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an application, we prove a tight lower-bound for the deterministic communication complexity of the communication problem, where Alice and Bob are each given $p$-many $n$-bit strings, with the promise that either all of the strings are distinct, or all-but-one of the strings are distinct, and they wish to know which is the case. We show that the complexity of this problem is $\Theta(p \cdot n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simulation Beats Richness: New Data-Structure Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://sagnikm.github.io/publication/stoc2018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We develop a technique for proving lower bounds in the setting of asymmetric communication, a model that was introduced in the famous works of Miltersen (STOC&#39;94) and Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson (STOC&#39;95). At the core of our technique is a novel simulation theorem. Alice gets a $p \times n$ matrix $x$ over $\mathbb F_2$ and Bob gets a vector $y \in \mathbb F_2^n$.  Alice and Bob need to evaluate $f(x\cdot y)$ for a Boolean function $f$. Our simulation theorems show that a deterministic/randomized communication protocol exists for this problem, with cost $C\cdot n$ for Alice and $C$ for Bob, if and only if there exists a deterministic/randomized \emph{parity decision tree} of cost $\Theta(C)$ for evaluating $f$. As applications of this technique, we obtain the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first strong lower-bounds against randomized data-structure schemes for the Vector-Matrix-Vector product problem over $\mathbb F_2$. Moreover, our method yields strong lower bounds even when the data-structure scheme has tiny advantage over random guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lower bounds against randomized data-structures schemes for two natural Boolean variants of Orthogonal Vector Counting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We construct an asymmetric communication problem and obtain a deterministic lower-bound for it which is provably better than any lower-bound that may be obtained by the classical Richness Method of Miltersen et al. This seems to be the first known limitation of the Richness Method in the context of proving deterministic lower bounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Lower Bounds for Elimination via Weak Regularity</title>
      <link>https://sagnikm.github.io/publication/stacs-2017/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the problem of elimination in communication complexity, that was first raised by Ambainis et al. and later studied by Beimel et al. for its connection to the famous direct sum question. In this problem, let $f : {0, 1}^{2n} \to {0, 1}$ be any boolean function. Alice and Bob get $k$ inputs $x_1, \cdots , x_k$ and $y_1, \cdots, y_k$ respectively, with $x_i, y_i \in {0, 1}^n$. They want to output a $k$-bit vector $v$, such that there exists one index $i$ for which $v_i \neq f(x_i, y_i)$. We prove a general result lower bounding the randomized communication complexity of the elimination problem for $f$ using its discrepancy. Consequently, we obtain strong lower bounds for the functions &lt;em&gt;InnerProduct&lt;/em&gt; and  &lt;em&gt;Greater-Than&lt;/em&gt;, that work for exponentially larger values of $k$ than the best previous bounds. To prove our result, we use a pseudo-random notion called regularity that was first used by Raz and Wigderson. We show that functions with small discrepancy are regular. We also observe that a weaker notion, that we call weak-regularity, already implies hardness of elimination. Finally, we give a different proof, borrowing ideas from Viola, to show that Greater-Than is weakly regular.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tribes is Hard in Message-passing Model</title>
      <link>https://sagnikm.github.io/publication/stacs2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We consider the point-to-point message passing model of
communication in which there are $k$ processors with individual
private inputs, each $n$-bit long. Each processor is located at the
node of an underlying undirected graph and has access to private
random coins. An edge of the graph is a private channel of
communication between its endpoints. The processors have to compute
a given function of all their inputs by communicating along these
channels. While this model has been widely used in distributed
computing, strong lower bounds on the amount of communication needed
to compute simple functions have just begun to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we prove a tight lower bound of $\Omega(kn)$ on the
communication needed for computing the Tribes function, when the
underlying graph is a star of $k+1$ nodes that has $k$ leaves with
inputs and a center with no input. Lower bound on this topology
easily implies comparable bounds for others.  Our lower bounds are
obtained by building upon the recent information theoretic
techniques of Braverman et.al [FOCS&#39;13] and combining it
with the earlier work of Jayram, Kumar and Sivakumar [STOC&#39;03]. This approach yields
information complexity bounds that is of independent interest.&lt;/p&gt;
