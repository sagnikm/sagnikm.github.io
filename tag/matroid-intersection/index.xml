      <description>&lt;p&gt;The matroid intersection problem is a fundamental problem that has been extensively studied for half a century. In the classic version of this problem, we are given two matroids ${\cal M}_1 = (V, {\cal I}_1)$ and ${\cal M}_2 = (V, {\cal I}_2)$ on a comment ground set $V$ of $n$ elements, and then we have to find the largest common independent set $S \in {\cal I}_1 \cap {\cal I}_2$ by making  &lt;em&gt;independence oracle queries&lt;/em&gt;  of the form &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Is $S \in {\cal I}_1$?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Is $S \in {\cal I}_2$?&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; for $S \subseteq V$. The goal is to minimize the number of queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beating the existing $\tilde O(n^2)$ bound, known as the &lt;em&gt;quadratic barrier&lt;/em&gt;, is an open problem that captures the limits of techniques from two lines of work. The first one is the classic Cunningham&amp;rsquo;s algorithm [SICOMP 1986], whose $\tilde O(n^2)$-query implementations were shown by CLS+ [FOCS 2019] and Nguyen [2019]. More generally, these algorithms take $\tilde O(nr)$ queries where $r$ denotes the rank which can be as big as $n$.  The other one is the general cutting plane method of Lee, Sidford, and Wong [FOCS 2015]. The only progress towards breaking the quadratic barrier requires either {\em approximation} algorithms or a more powerful &lt;em&gt;rank oracle query&lt;/em&gt; [CLS+ FOCS 2019]. No exact algorithm with $o(n^2)$ independence queries was known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we break the quadratic barrier with a randomized algorithm guaranteeing $\tilde O(n^{9/5})$ independence queries with high probability, and a deterministic algorithm guaranteeing $\tilde O(n^{11/6})$ independence queries. Our key insight is simple and fast algorithms to solve a graph reachability problem that arose in the standard augmenting path framework [Edmonds 1968]. Combining this with previous exact and approximation algorithms leads to our results.&lt;/p&gt;
